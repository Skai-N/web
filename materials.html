    <h1> Materials </h1>
      <p>   When creating a LEGO stop motion animation, it is important to have a camera, a dark space, desk lamps, and the LEGO set.
        The camera does not have to be anything fancy--even a phone will do. A dark area and the usage of desk lamps will get rid of any light flickering that comes with using other lighting methods such as the natural light, as a desk lamp's brightness is stable.
        A general rule when building the set for the shot is to build only what the camera can see. There is no need to build an entire cityscape if the scene will only take part on one street.
        This makes it faster to get started and easier to move the LEGO characters when shooting the scene. This also means that you don't need as many LEGO pieces to make a film.
        If you plan on using a LEGO plate as the floor, be sure to tape down the plate to avoid moving around the scene.

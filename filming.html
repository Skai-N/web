    <h1> Filming </h1>
      <p>   Before filming, decide on the FPS that you will be shooting in. FPS stands for "frames per second," meaning how many pictures will be required to make 1 second of video.
        Determining the FPS that you want to shoot at before starting the film will help you decide how much to move your pieces for each movement.
        The higher the FPS, the smoother the animation will look, but this will require you to take more pictures. A good beginner FPS range is anywhere between 8 and 12 fps.
        When filming any movement, the general rule is to "ease in, and ease out." This means that as a movement beging and ends, you take more pictures than you did when the actual movement happens.
        This prevents any unnatural abrupt beginnings or endings to the movement. Learning certain walk cycles may also help speed up the animation process as you will no longer have to think about how much to move a leg, and the walking will be consistent throughout the cycle.

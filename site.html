    <h1> LEGO Stop Motion </h1>
    <p> LEGO stop motion is a branch from the tradition style of animation that utilizes drawing. The basis of stop motion rests on creating the illusion of motion using a library of still images.
       This illusion is created by switching the image in a fraction of a second to the next image. Because of this method however, many variables must be controlled to keep the animation consistent.
       These include lighting, setting, and the camera angle. Even miniscule changes in such variables are extemely noticeable in the animation. In order to create a smooth animation, each movement must consist of many micromovements throughout many photos.
      This makes the filming process longer than both the planning and postproduction phases. This site is a short guide to LEGO stop motion that touches on the materials needed, technique, and postproduction of LEGO stop motion. </p>

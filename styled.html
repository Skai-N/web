    <h1> Materials </h1>
      <p>   When creating a LEGO stop motion animation, it is important to have a camera, a dark space, desk lamps, and the LEGO set.
        The camera does not have to be anything fancy--even a phone will do. A dark area and the usage of desk lamps will get rid of any light flickering that comes with using other lighting methods such as the natural light, as a desk lamp's brightness is stable.
        A general rule when building the set for the shot is to build only what the camera can see. There is no need to build an entire cityscape if the scene will only take part on one street.
        This makes it faster to get started and easier to move the LEGO characters when shooting the scene. This also means that you don't need as many LEGO pieces to make a film.
        If you plan on using a LEGO plate as the floor, be sure to tape down the plate to avoid moving around the scene.

    <h1> Filming </h1>
      <p>   Before filming, decide on the FPS that you will be shooting in. FPS stands for "frames per second," meaning how many pictures will be required to make 1 second of video.
        Determining the FPS that you want to shoot at before starting the film will help you decide how much to move your pieces for each movement.
        The higher the FPS, the smoother the animation will look, but this will require you to take more pictures. A good beginner FPS range is anywhere between 8 and 12 fps.
        When filming any movement, the general rule is to "ease in, and ease out." This means that as a movement beging and ends, you take more pictures than you did when the actual movement happens.
        This prevents any unnatural abrupt beginnings or endings to the movement. Learning certain walk cycles may also help speed up the animation process as you will no longer have to think about how much to move a leg, and the walking will be consistent throughout the cycle.

     <h1> Postproduction </h1>
      <p> After filming, you will need to compile all of the shots into one coherent film. If you created your animation in chronological order, this step should not be very difficult, as your images will already be in order.
         However, if you planned on shooting multiple scenes in the same place and filmed the scenes one after another instead, organizing your shots into different labeled folders will help.
         By doing this, you will save time by not having to build the same set multiple times, and you also will not have to go looking through a large directory of photos to rearrange your scenes.
         During this phase, you may also add in video effects, sounds, or more.

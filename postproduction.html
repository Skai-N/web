    <h1> Postproduction </h1>
      <p> After filming, you will need to compile all of the shots into one coherent film. If you created your animation in chronological order, this step should not be very difficult, as your images will already be in order.
         However, if you planned on shooting multiple scenes in the same place and filmed the scenes one after another instead, organizing your shots into different labeled folders will help.
         By doing this, you will save time by not having to build the same set multiple times, and you also will not have to go looking through a large directory of photos to rearrange your scenes.
         During this phase, you may also add in video effects, sounds, or more.
